This MATLAB software implements the denoising algorithm (Poisson NL means)
for images damaged by Poisson noise as presented in: "Poisson NL means:
unsupervised non local means for poisson noise", C.A. Deledalle, F. Tupin
and L. Denis, IEEE Conf. on Image Processing, Sepetember 2010.

This software is free and should be used only for nonprofit purposes. Any
unauthorized use of this software for industrial or profit-oriented
activities is expressively prohibited.

The program has been written for MATLAB with the ImageProcessing Toolbox and the Statistics
Toolbox for Linux 32-bit or 64-bit and Windows 32-bit.

The following program files are present:

- poisson_nlmeans_kernel.mex*:
  A Mex function wich performs non local Poisson denoising with given
  filtering parameters. This program provide first and second order
  differentials of the risk (PURE).

- poisson_nlmeans.m:
  A matlab function wich calls iteratively the poisson_nlmeans_kernel.mex*
  program to perform the denoising and research the optimal filtering
  parameters via Newton's method.

- poisson_nlmeans_example.m:
  An example of how to use the poisson nl means filter. It denoises the
  Pepper image (pepper.tif) corrupted by Poisson noise with a maximum
  intensity of 20. A pre-filtering images is provided by moving average (MA)
  filtering (see diskconvolution.m). The set of parameters are the same as
  those given in the corresponding paper.

- diskconvolution.m:
  Realized a moving average filtering with a disk kernel by using
  2 dimensional convolution.

- psnr.m:
  Computes the PSNR values given the height of the peak.

- plotimage.m:
  Plot a grayscale image with pixel values ranged on [0..255].
